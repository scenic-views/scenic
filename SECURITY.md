# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Scenic maintainenance is a volunteer effort. We will do our best to fix
forward but do not offer backported fixes. As such, the only "supported" version of Scenic is whichever was most recently released.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any discovered security vulnerabilities to Scenic's primary
volunteer maintainers, derekprior@gmail.com and caleb@calebhearth.com.

We will respond as soon as possible with any follow-up questions or details
on how we plan to handle the issue.
